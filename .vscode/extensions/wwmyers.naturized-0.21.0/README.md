# A Naturized version of Solarized
#### Try out my new theme Hackpot for a more naturistic feel with more language support. It's similar to Naturized, but with my own syntax highlighting instead of using Solarized. It's now my main theme. In my opinion, it's much better all around. Might cancel this theme, no point in having 2 similar themes. I will never cancel Hackpot! If you want me to keep this theme, because you prefer this syntax highlighting of Solarized over Hackpot, please let me know on my repo. I'll decide Feb 1st 2020.
