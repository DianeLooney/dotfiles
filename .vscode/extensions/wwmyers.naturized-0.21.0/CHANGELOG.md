# Change Log

All notable changes to the "naturized" extension will be documented in this file.

## Switched the greens and oranges
### Reasons
* While choosing which colors to use, I was going off of several small files that did a bunch of term functions. It looked good in those files, but when you brought up a real production type file, orange dominated over the green. Unless you had a bunch of comments, the garden was lost. A solid example is check out the jquery file here https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.js with the color theme and imagine the bright greens being orange.
* CSS also had no garden feel, now it does.

## Switched the browns and oranges
### Reasons
* While testing on several languages, the way brown was used made it hard to see the braces. Some languages has a lot of braces and if you're missing one, you need to be able to spot them easily.
* Orange was widely used and almost took away the feel of a garden in some languages. Also, on HTML tags, the orange was over powering the brackets, couldn't see them, now you can. 

#### With these changes, going across as many languages that I've used in the past, the garden feel is represented pretty well across all languages, while keeping the same syntax highlighting system as Solarized.
#### Think I'm finally done making major changes to the color theme. If I make anymore, it'll be for certain features I might of missed that I haven't used yet from VSCode itself.
#### If you see any major issues, post it on my repo :)
